With key experience in the UVC protocol, we can help you with your uvc-gadget
based project.

## UVC-Gadget : Plug and Play Streaming video 

Utilising UVC-Gadget will allow your device to stream video directly over UVC
to a host PC or device.  Ideas on Board can help you write custom userspace to
generate or capture and process the imagery for your system.

Our UVC-Gadget application is a starting point to configure and support the
userspace requirements of the UVC protocol when working with the USB gadget
stack in Linux
